<#
.SYNOPSIS
    Starts or stops the Docker Compose project for this repository on Windows.

.DESCRIPTION
    This script manages the Docker Compose project defined by the repository's
    docker-compose.yml file:

      1. With -Start, it runs "docker compose up -d" to build (if needed) and
         start the services, then prints the service status.
      2. With -Stop, it runs "docker compose down --remove-orphans" to stop and
         remove the services. Unless -RemoveVolumes or -RemoveImages is passed,
         it prompts whether the associated docker volumes and images should also
         be cleaned up. Removing the images means the project will do a full
         rebuild the next time it is started.
      3. Exactly one of -Start or -Stop must be provided; specifying both is an error.

.PARAMETER Stop
    Stop and remove the docker compose project. If -RemoveVolumes and -RemoveImages
    are not both specified, you will be prompted about cleaning up volumes and images.

.PARAMETER Start
    Start the docker compose project (building images first if needed) and print
    the service status.

.PARAMETER Cleanup
    Reserved. In the current implementation, cleanup of volumes and images is
    controlled by the -RemoveVolumes and -RemoveImages switches.

.PARAMETER Help
    Show this help message and exit without doing anything.

.PARAMETER ComposeFile
    Path to the docker-compose file to manage.
    Default: <script directory>\..\docker-compose.yml (BuildTools\docker-compose.yml)

.PARAMETER RemoveVolumes
    Remove the named docker volumes defined by the compose file when stopping the project.

.PARAMETER RemoveImages
    Remove the docker images used by the compose project after stopping it.
    NOTE: removing the images forces a full rebuild the next time the project starts.

.EXAMPLE
    .\compose_project.ps1 -Start
    Starts the docker compose project (building images first if needed).

.EXAMPLE
    .\compose_project.ps1 -Stop
    Stops and removes the compose project, prompting about cleaning up volumes and images.

.EXAMPLE
    .\compose_project.ps1 -Stop -RemoveVolumes -RemoveImages
    Stops the project and removes its volumes and images without prompting.

.EXAMPLE
    .\compose_project.ps1 -Start -ComposeFile "C:\path\to\docker-compose.yml"
    Starts a project defined by a custom compose file.

.EXAMPLE
    .\compose_project.ps1 -Help
    Displays usage information.

.NOTES
    Requirements: Docker (Docker Desktop) installed and running.
